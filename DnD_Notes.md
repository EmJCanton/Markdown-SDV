# Cintessa's First Dream

For the past month your dreams have been *fitful* and *strange*, dreams of a woman whose voice rasps from behind a darkened veil. This garment conceals all features, save for a pair of **pure white eyes** that seem to stare deep into your soul. 

In each dream, she speaks of secrets of your past – knowledge buried so deep not a single other soul could know. She speaks of *ambition* and *envy*, of mistakes made and lives lost. She speaks of answers to questions **you’d never thought to ask**, of awakened power and a rewound clock. She speaks of threads of fate, **cut too soon**, and the means to their mending. 

In the final dream she whispered thus
>The fate of one dear was cut asunder too soon, and years of soldiering and service have yet to shift the weight of failure. But that >is not the end of your road, or of those you search for in your dreams… And your nightmares. Seek the Marksman, the Knight, the >Huntress and the Faded Man. You will find them in the home of the night’s steed, east of the safety of the trail’s ending and upon >the edge of the mist bound woods. Their threads of fate are bound to yours, and will lead you to your destiny.

Then, a flash of light and an image that burned into your mind; *a woman with her eyes closed in concentration. One hand was bathed in light and the other shrouded in darkness, and between them hovered a corona of stars.* 

Then, nothing but darkness and the fitful stirring of awakening. 

When you awoke, the moon still high in the night’s sky, you waited for the dream to fade from your mind as all the others had, to be consigned to memory as yet another figment of an overactive imagination. Instead, you felt the vision solidify, clarify – *and felt a weight in your lap, a quill in your hand.* When you looked down you saw a scrap of parchment, the ink upon it still fresh; And upon it, scrawled in handwriting you recognized as your own, the word “**Conjurer**”. 

The next day you made a list:
- [ ] pack your belongings 
- [ ] prepare for a journey
- [ ] scoured your maps
- [ ] settle upon your most likely destination - The town of Trail’s End in far away Damara.
- [ ] then the Dunwood – also known as the Forest of Mists – to its east. 

The road lay before you, your past and your family’s scorn at your back. 

And as the pale Autumn sun rose overhead, you 
1. steeled your will, 
2. cleared your mind, 
3. and let fate guide your steps onwards.
